ðŸ§  How It Works

The app loads a unique browser fingerprint using FingerprintJS Pro.

It uses that ID to fetch and manage tasks belonging to that specific user.

All data fetching and mutations are handled via React Query for efficient caching and UI updates.

Toast notifications are used for instant feedback on actions.
